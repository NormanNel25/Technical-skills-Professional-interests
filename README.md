> During my studies, we have a module namely project. This module serves as a unit where we as students work collectively in a group project to apply our knowledge in a practical way. This includes research, supervision by a professor for guidance and deliverable.

This stream I chose is Communication Networks and this was one of the projects I did:

We were tasked design (and improve) network typology which is suitable across all four campuses namely, cape town, mowbray, bellville & wellington. I was elected the group leader and thus responsible for the groups progress. Now this project is divided into 4 terms (2 semesters) with each carrying a weight or percentage towards the end year mark out of 100. 

For term 1 we had to deliver a scope of roles and responsibilities as to who will contribute to which unit and this had to be submitted along with our student names in a pdf document 
> **Please note all documents are uploaded and not in readme**

Second term we had to design a topology suiteable for these campuses and is attached in files under heading, "TOPOLOGY". What we used is a 3 tier higherarchical model (access layer, distribution layer and core layer) in order for our multilayer 3 switches to work across all campuses. Layer 3 switches share the same function as Layer 2 router which means L3 switches are responsible for routing and switching. When designing this we used a suitable addressing scheme to accomodate all units (routers, switches, access points etc) as shown in the ip addressing scheme file.
For term 3 we designed the network using packet tracer, our network toplogy, ip addressing schemes and commands on each unit I will attach a link for basic commands to view them on each component please refer to network functionality in files and download packet tracer apk for viewing.
Last and final term 4 deliverable we had to submit individual contributions on how we did our project. Please refer to Final and last deliverable on files.

ðŸ›  Learning occured through practice of coursework, research, youtube videos and through peer group discussions and this was quite the experience!

Key lessons learned:
- Effective communication
- Collaboration and Teamwork
- Conflict Resolution
- Accountablility and Responsibility
