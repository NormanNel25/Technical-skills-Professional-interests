> During my studies, we have a module namely project. This module serves as a unit where we as students work collectively in a group project to apply our knowledge in a practical way. This includes research, supervision by a professor for guidance and deliverable.

This stream I chose is Communication Networks and this was one of the projects I did:

We were tasked design (and improve) network typology which is suitable across all four campuses namely, cape town, mowbray, bellville & wellington. I was elected the group leader and thus responsible for the groups progress. Now this project is divided into 4 terms (2 semesters) with each carrying a weight or percentage towards the end year mark out of 100. 

For term 1 we had to deliver a scope of roles and responsibilities as to who will contribute to which unit and this had to be submitted along with our student names in a pdf document
